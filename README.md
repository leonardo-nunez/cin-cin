# Cin Cin

A simple but good looking cocktail recipe app.

During "hackday" att </SALT> we had to create our first full-stack app from scratch in 24 hours.

The external API that I use to get the data is: http://www.thecocktaildb.com/

## Tech Stack

**Language:** JavaScript

**Client:** React

**Server:** Node, Express

## Demo

https://cin-cin.herokuapp.com/

## Challenges and future features

One of the challenges with the task was planning and time constraint. There were some additional features that didn't make it, at least into this version of the app.

There is an about page and a favorites feature in the code that are not used. There's also a way to get the full cocktails list.

In the figma screenshot below you can also see a second page where you can see all the cocktails in alphabetical order. That page wasn't really needed after I changed the search bar for an autocomplete input component.
